### Project Vision

Final year project proposal

Community Skate App

I will be developing a skateboarding community mobile application using React Native which will use a NodeJS API. The app will assist users in learning how to skateboard and help connect them with the skateboarding community.

The intention is to provide a service for locating skaters to increase the size of the skateboarding community by knowledge sharing and provide the means for skateboarders that feel disconnected with the community to reconnect.
Another intention is to provide a tool for skateboarders that they can use to aid in their development by offering a collection of information to learn from and record their progress against.

The importance of doing this project is that I will acquire experience in languages and technologies that I wish to pursue in the future. The final year project is a hot topic of discussion during job interviews after university, and I want to make something that I can be proud of.

This project should be done because there isnâ€™t much offering the tools and services that my application will offer. From researching similar applications, there are some that offer similar functionality or only 1 feature. These applications would be much more desirable if they incorporated more functionality around skateboarding rather than a single feature - (e.g an app that records tricks, an app that teaches tricks, an app to socialise with other skaters compared to 1 app the offers all functionality in one place).

The problem is that there isn't much community involvement when it comes to learning skateboarding and getting involved in the skateboarding community. Most people start learning to skate with a pre-existing group of friends or learn on their own by watching videos online or being taught by more experienced skaters. The solution to this problem is to create a mobile application, so it can be used on-the-go and at the park, to provide information for beginners to learn the basics, record their progress to show/share to their friends and provide a tool for locating other skaters in the community to get involved with others, or advertise themselves as willing to teach others. This will create a larger community of skateboarders and promote knowledge sharing.
